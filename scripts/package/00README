As of LSB 4.0 devel, this build requires a setup specdb 
and the environment variables to access it, similar to 
the setup for building the specdb itself:

LSBUSER, LSBDBPASSWORD, LSBDBHOST and LSBDB

So make gensrc creates lsb-perl-modules.list , pulling 
the LSB list of modules from InterpretedLanguageModule, 
InterpretedLanguage.
