As of LSB 4.0 devel, this build requires a setup specdb 
and the environment variables to access it, similar to 
the setup for building the specdb itself:

LSBUSER, LSBDBPASSWORD, LSBDBHOST and LSBDB

So make modules_list creates lists/lsb-perl-modules.list 
at each build, pulling the LSB list of modules from
InterpretedLanguageModule, InterpretedLanguage.
